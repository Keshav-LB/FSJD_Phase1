1. what is program?
	A Program is defined as the set of instruction which are intended to perform some activity.

2. what is programming language?
	A programming language is defined as the set of instruction used to establish a communication 
	between the programmer and the machine.

3. what are the different level of programming ?
	The programming world is divided into 3 parts:
	1. Machine level language:
		code is written in 0's and 1's Binary language
		Difficult to debug(finding the root cause of the issue)
		Difficult to understand
	2. Assembly level language:
		code is written in pneumonic format
		eg.: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, STR
		Debugging is simple
		confusion in case of registers
	3. High level Language:
		code is written in symbolic fashion
		eg.: +,-,*,/
		very easy to to debug as compared to any other language
		Easy understood by humans
	
4. what are the different high level language HLL?
	The most important HLL's are:
	1. Basic combined programming Language(BPCL):
		first popoular HLL
		It occupy more memory
		Because of above disadvantages BCPL became expensive language
		Non portable
	2. B language:
		popoular HLL
		It occupy more memory
		Not structured
		Non portable
	3. C language:
		popular HLL from decades
		it occupy less memory
		It is Structured
		Non-portable
		It was not Object oriented
	4. C++ Language:
		popular HLL from decades
		it occupy less memory
		It is Structured
		Non-portable
		It is object oriented
	5. Java programming language:
		popular HLL from decades
		It occupy less memory
		it is portable
		It supports internet
		It supports enterprise web application development
		
5. what is a class in java:
	A class is defined as blue print of an object.
	the class does not exists in reality
	It is with the help of the class that we will be defining how an object looks like.

6. what is object?
	An object is defined as the instance of the class
	An object is the real world entity which has an existence.
	we can create multiple object of a particular class
	we cannot create object of 2 class together as a single entity
	
7. what is object orientation?
	Object: Real world entity
	Orientation: perspective
	Object Orientation: Perspective towards real world entity

8. what are the principles of object orientation?
	There are basically 5 principle of Object orientation
	1. The world is collection of object
	2. Every object is usefull and no object is useless
	3. Every object is under constant interaction.
	4. Every object belongs to a class and the class is just a blue print.
	5. EVery object has something and every object does something.

9. create a simple class with 5 properties and 5 behaviours
	properties---> has part ---->data-types
	behaviours --->does part ----> methods
	
	DOG
			properties: name, age, colour, cost, breed
			
			behaviours: run, walk, eat, sleep, bark
			
			
	class DOG
	{
		//properties
			String name;
			int age;
			String colour;
			int cost;
			String breed
			
		//behaviours
			void run(){}
			void walk() {}
			void eat() {}
			void sleep() {}
			void bark() {}	
	}

10. what is the process of compilation?	
		HLL--->compiler--->MLL--->RAM--->processor--->O/p
		Incase of compiler the code will be converted to MLL in a single go.

11. what is interpretation?
		High level line-->interpreter--->BinaryLine --->RAM ---> Processor ---> Output
		
		In Case of interpreter the code will be converted to MLL line by line.

12. Is Java compiled Programming Language or an interpreted programming language?
		java is both compiled as well as interpreted language.

13. what is the syntax of a method?
		layman approach:
			output_from_method    name_of_method(input_to_method)
			{
					-----(Body of method)
			}
		
		Technical approach:
			return_type    name_of_method(parameters)
			{
					-----(Body of method)
			}
			Examples:
			void add(){
				System.out.println("add method");
			}
			
			int add(int a, int b)
			{
				return a+b;
			}
	
14. what are the different types of methods?
		there are 4 types:
			NANR-- No Argument No Return_Value 
			NAWR-- No Argument With Return_Value
			WANR-- With Argument No Return_Value
			WAWR-- With Argument With Return_Value
	
15. Hello World program in java
		class Program1{
			public static void main(String args[])
				{
					System.out.println("Hello World");
				}
		}
		Main Method in java:
			1. public: to make it visible or available for all.
			2. static : to make it accessible for all and also to execute this method 
						without creating object	
			3. void: no return value.
			4. String args[]: The array of string passed as the input to the main method.
	
		java code --> Java compiler --> ILL --> JVM -->MLL-->RAM-->Processor-->Output
		
		ILL---> Intermediate level language
		JVM --> Java Virtual Machine is responsible for converting ILL to MLL

16. what are variable?
		A variable is a storage space where we can store some data.
		There are 3 types of Variable:
			1.Instance Variable
			2.Local Variable
			3.Static Variable

17. what are Instance Variable?
		Any variable present directly inside the class is called as the instance variable.
		The Instance variable will get default values allocated form the JVM.
		The Instance variable will get the memory allocated in the heap segment.
		The Instance variable are also called  as object variables because-
		-these variables will always be associated with the object being created.
		
18. what are Local variable?
		Any variable present directly inside the method is called as the Local variable.
		The Local variable will not get default values.
		The Local variable will get the memory allocated in the stack segment.
		The Local variable are not associated with the object being created rather they are-
		-associated with the methods inside which they are present.
			

19. what are static variable?
		Any variable present directly inside the class and associated with "Static Keyword" 
		is called as the Static variable.
		The STatic variables are firstly the instance variables with static privileges.
		The Static variable will get default values allocated form the JVM.
		The Static variable will get the memory allocated in the static segment.
		The Static variable are also called  as VIP variables because-
		-these variables will get the memory allocated first and only once.


20. What are the different types of data in java?
		Real world data 					Representation in java 				format used
		textual type of data		 		char data type 						ASCII or UTF
		integer type real world	data		byte, short, int, long 				base-2 format
		real number type real world data	float, double 						IEEE
		image 								built in fuctions 					jvm dependent
		audio 								built in fuctions 					jvm dependent
		video 								built in fuctions 					jvm dependent
		yes/no -- true/false 				boolean 							jvm dependent


21. What are the segregations of Datatypes in java?
		In Java the datatypes are segregated into 2 types:
			i. Primitive Datatype:
				ex: int, short, byte ,long, float, double, char, etc
			ii. Non-Primitive Datatype:
				ex: Objects and Wrapper
